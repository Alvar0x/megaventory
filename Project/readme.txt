| What did you do? |
|------------------|
First, I had to research the API to be able to use it.
Once I familiarized with it, I used client URLs (cURL) to send the JSON data to the Megaventory API via POST.
Furthermore, I created the necessary classes for this project, so that you can create any entity easily.
I also have made a form to enter the data much easier!

| How does it relate to a project of your CV (if any)? |
|------------------------------------------------------|
I haven't attached any project to the CV.
This is the first time I make a 'real-life' project with a new API, but I really like it.
